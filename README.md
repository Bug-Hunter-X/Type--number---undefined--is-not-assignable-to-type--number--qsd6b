# Type 'number | undefined' is not assignable to type 'number'
This bug demonstrates a common TypeScript error that occurs when a function that is expected to return a number may return undefined under certain circumstances. The error message arises when TypeScript's type checker detects this potential mismatch between the expected return type (number) and the actual type of the variable (number | undefined). This typically happens when a function's return value depends on a conditional check and might not always produce a number.   The solution involves ensuring that the function always returns a number, either by handling the undefined case explicitly or by refining the function's return type to reflect the possibility of undefined.
